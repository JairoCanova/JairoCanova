#Draft Proposal for Book Club 2.0

# 1. Book Sharing

- Rocketeers can exchange exclusively physical books purchased through the Learning program.
- Sender and receiver must live in the same country.
- Receiver agrees to share a delivery address.
- Rocket.Chat will reimburse the mail delivery. Sender is responsible to find the best shipping price.
*In Brasil Correios has a book-exclusive category. Read more on ["Impresso MÃ³dico"](https://www.correios.com.br/enviar/marketing-direto/saiba-mais-nacional)

* How it works: 
- Rocketeers can publish in the Book Club channel what books they have to share, stating their country.
- Anyone interested can request as many books as they want. 
- Receiver will share a delivery address in private. 
- Sender is resposible to ship and present People Team a receipt for reimbursement.
- Optional: Rocketeers near our offices can use them to drop and pick up books without shipping costs.
*Be responsible, ask for books relevant to your current role or carreer path. We trust your judgement.

* Additionally: *Create a space in our offices where Rocketeers can freely drop their books and grab any available.

* Reasons why you might want to give away your books:
- Content no longer scope of your work
- Space for new books
- Book was not what you expected or didn't had what you needed
- You know by heart and don't need a physical copy
- Do not intend to reread
- You have another book with similar content

# 2. Changes in RockStars

- End the points system for Book Club.

- Updated rule: "Books read are awarded as courses".
- Award 5 stars for every 100 pages, to a max of 50 stars.
*Example: finished "Principles by Ray Dalio", 592 pages. 
*Go to Zoho People > Compensation > RockStars and request 25 stars.

- Valid for technical, business and self-improvement books. Fiction don't award stars (same rule applied to courses).
